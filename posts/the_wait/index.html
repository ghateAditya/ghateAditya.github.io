<p>They say good things come to those who wait. Maybe it is true. But waiting is not easy. It tests your patience and resilience like anything. But wait turns painful when it is associated with a person whom you love. And I am not blaming the person who we are waiting for, but you understand what longing for someone&rsquo;s love and attention means. And then you start seeking it in different ways. This is something I had to learn and go through because I am so used to you being there with me. I just need one person and my world is complete. You find ways to pass time by finding something to do with whoever is available. I cannot function when my person is not around. This Cali thing in itself would have been very difficult for me because I am used to being around you 24/7, but now with the added mess it becomes extremely difficult. I feel like a kachua without its shell. Vulnerable, unsure and intimidated by the world around me.</p>
<p>I try to get through my day though. To keep myself occupied. I have started working for some time now. Working as in actually trying to work without any distractions and trying to wrap my head around the project so that I can stop thinking about you for a while. I worked for 4 hours and 10 minutes on a piece of code today. It was not at all enjoyable but atleast it got me through the day. I go to the gym for 1.5 hours to kill time. I come home and make food to pass time. All through the day I try to kill time instead of waiting for you. But once I am finished with everything and come into my room, this is where the wait gets unbearable. For some reason I have not been able to relax ever since I have been away from you. I have not been able to enjoy all these fancy things that I buy for myself. Because all my happiness comes from you baccha. I put too much of myself into you. I am not complaining. People spend their entire lives looking for a purpose to live, to find something or someone which will make their life fulfilling. Some people find it in religion. Some people find their calling in social service(except Vibhuti) and politics. Some people search for it in creative ways of expression. For me it is you. And I cannot say this enough but something in me changes ever since I am with you. You make me a better person in so many ways without doing amything. You exist and make my life better. And I am not exaggerating.</p>
<p>But you are your own person, and no matter how much I crave for you none of it would matter if you don&rsquo;t feel the same. And right now I guess you dont. And it is very hard for me to live with that fact. And yet I wait. I wait and wait. I have my good days and bad days. One day I am hopeful and healing, on the other I am having a breakdown. But I don&rsquo;t give up on either of these days. Because I am hopeful that the connection we have is something special that would never happen again. It is almost poetic that I feel we are meant for each other.</p>
<p>Speaking of poetic, these are some of the lyrics from a song called You that I am vibing on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All I do is think about how your leap of faith made me put all my faith in you
All I do is think about you
All I do is think about how long will I have to wait until I say &lsquo;I do&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so I wait. I waited for 4-5 days before finally asking you about the virtual date on Valentines. I will wait for 14 days to show you what I have made. This blog. Everytime I wrote something I wanted to show it you because I get excited thinking how excited you&rsquo;ll be when I keep giving you these random chijju&rsquo;s. But I do hope this turns out to be good and you like it. That you dont find it boring to read through everything like my long messages :( Kya karoon main I express better than words. Just now I was saying ki people spend their entire lives trying to find their purpose. For me it is you. It has always been you. I have written more in the last 8 days than I ever did. And I thought mere pass kuch bachega hi bolne k liye. But you keep me going. On and on. All puns intended&hellip;</p>
