<p>I learnt about something called a love language. Turns out every individual has a specific love language that they speak. It is their own way of expressing love for their partner. Understanding each other&rsquo;s love language becomes important to know how your partner exprsses their love and vice versa. This was new information for me because I understood both of our ways to express love are different. And for a long time I used to get sad when you didn&rsquo;t express yourself or say things out loud. Because that is what expressing love meant to me.</p>
<p>Turns out having all of these expectations was wrong on my part. I am sorry you felt all this pressure from my end. I never meant it to happen. But at the same time let me put forth my side using the same information. A person&rsquo;s love language may also be the primary way that they may expect love and attention from their partner. I spoke the language of expression and intimacy, so naturally kept on expecting the same from you. I realise what was wrong on my end. I also did some research. Turns out there are 5 different love languages.</p>
<ul>
<li>Physical Touch</li>
<li>Words of affirmation</li>
<li>Acts of Service</li>
<li>Quality time</li>
<li>Receiving Gifts</li>
</ul>
<p>There&rsquo;s this small quiz that you can take which tells you what your love language is. I took it and results are really insigtful.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><figure><img src="quiz.jpg"/>

</code></pre><p>Turns out I speak 4 out of the 5 categories. This is both good news and bad news. Good news because I would use all of these things to express my love for you. And I know I did. Bad news because I kept on expecting these as well which was wrong on my part. But lesson learnt. Now I know what to do. Why is it that I become introspective when you&rsquo;re not around. Maybe because you&rsquo;re close I fall stupidly and hopelessly in love for you.</p>
<p>You can take the quiz too and let me know what&rsquo;s your language.

<p>But I kind of know when I look back. Every time you were away you kept sending me all those messages about what you were doing and what was going on. That was your way of showing love. Every night when sleepily said good night and held my hand, you were saying how much you loved me. Every time you brought me food from micron or a freebie from any event it was your way of showing love.</p>
<p>I promise you I will try my best to speak your language. Subtle quick learner flex :p</p>
<p>But I also promise you to not burden you with my expectations. Staying away from you ever since we&rsquo;ve come back from India made me realise I can crave you all the time yet be happy that you are able to spend your time not being sad. Although it does make me wonder if you think about me, but I should learn to live with it I guess&hellip;</p>
