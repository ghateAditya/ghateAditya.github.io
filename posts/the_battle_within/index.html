<p>Thoughts shape the world within and beyond. Pretty heavy statement to make, but I can back it up. You live in a world that your mind perceives. And your version of reality might be different than the actual. You are what your thoughts make you believe, and your thoughts are responsible for the way you interact with others and shape their version of reality. Thoughts affect mood, health and almost everything. Which is why I feel meditation is the greatest skill one can practice. If a person can see the thoughts going through the mind and think of them as clouds in the sky, he gets closer to the actual reality and is able to see the world as it is. I tried doing it for a year and I did feel a difference. I have seen the effect good and bad thoughts can have. Maybe this is why I will never be able to say something hurtful to the people I love, even though it tears me apart from within.</p>
<p>Today was a perfect example of what thoughts can do to your mood. You start off the day normally but you find a linkedin connection request from a girl who says she found my profile on a &ldquo;matrimonial&rdquo; site interesting. You realise what your father might have done and you call up your mother and tell her what has happened. You realise how accepting your mother is when she understands your anger towards your father, when you tell her noone should be able to control your life based on what they want. Your mother tells you dont share everything with your father, and that even she does not need to know everything that is going on in my life, but if there happens to be a girl in my life she tell me. She believes I would have chosen the right girl and take decisions all on your own. I wanted to tell her then. That I found the person I want to spend the rest of my life with. That this person is so special you can feel therr love, their pain, their anger in a way that greatly affects how you function. I wanted to tell my mother I understood what being grateful means, when you feel you don&rsquo;t need anything else. And this is all because of you. But you dont know what this girl thinks of you. If she even feels something about you. So you keep quiet. You feel anger towards your father, love towards your mother and fear of losing your partner at the same time.</p>
<p>You see? My day was already ruined before you even woke up. But if my girl doesn&rsquo;t feel well, I cannot focus on anything else until I find a way to make you feel better, irrespective of how I am doing. Because only one of us should be having a hard time ek time pe. I thought of what could make you happy and feel like you are being taken care of, chahe main kitna bhi door hu. Because being there for you when you are at your most vulnerable self is what I will always do. I will always be there for you. You will never be alone ever again. And jab tune bataya tujhe pasand aaya to my day went from bad to super good in super short time. So much ki I did not let alcohol bring out my bad side bas itna jaan ke ki you liked the cake that I ordered. But when you get home and are excited to talk to the person who matters the most, you are shattered when the same person tells you they have no enery to deal with you. In moments your day can go from being awesome to shit, just because of the thoughts that drove the other person.</p>
