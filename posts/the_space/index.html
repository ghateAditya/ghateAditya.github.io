<p>Wohooo, day 9 of showering all my love into words. Well not all of it. You cannot quantify a reservoir. Its endless. But if I had to throw numbers at you, then 14. I left you 14 reels ka syllabus to look at before coming in to type this. I like to think tu dekhti to hogi atleast, even when you don&rsquo;t reply. I like to think you care, even when you don&rsquo;t show it. Correction. I know you care, and have your own way of expressing it.</p>
<p>Kal baat karte karte tere muh se nikal gaya&hellip;ki 5:30 hote hi lagta h bahot raat ho gaya. Kyuki main bhi to 2 timezones main ji rahi hu. And the expression on your face felt like you didn&rsquo;t mean to say it. But that sentence meant a lot to me. Like I use these small things and stack them up to rise above the sea of tears borne out of overthinking. Kya line h waah. Full bakchodi. Sometimes I wonder what will you think after I show you this blog. The difference in this and all the gifts from before was that every time I saw something or wanted to gift something, I knew exactly how you would feel after receiving that gift. I like to think I know you so well. But this blog, it&rsquo;s new for me too. I don&rsquo;t know how it will turn out so I don&rsquo;t know what you will feel about it. Isliye I have a backup gift. Well its not a backup gift. Its a valentines gift/housewarming gift. I have thought about it. The virtual date will cover the cheesy and romantic aspect. This blog will cover the deeper connection and &ldquo;how much you mean to me&rdquo; aspect. There needs to be another aspect that is tangible and something that you will actually need. After careful deliberation, I have decided it is going to be a Google Nest hub. Mist color main. The other contenders were a floor lamp similar to the one I have, an electric toothbrush, hair styler mere dimag main tha but aapne khud hi order kar diya vo. I think it will great on your desk, and it will help you with a lot of things. This is like letting you inside my brain. Now you know everything.</p>
<p>Now before you question the title of this post, I think all this distance apart actually makes people get fonder of each other. Because when we used to be together all the time, all the levels of love and affection were met. But here, thousands of miles apart, I like to find ways to make you smile and feel loved. 14 days of effort into the blog, asking you out on a virtual date a week before, deciding the other gift are all gestures that are not necessary, but meaningful. The gifts dont matter, the thought behind them matters. And all this is possible because you are so far away. The space between us has actually brought us closer together. Nahi to I would never have been able to spend hours into this site. And working on this does not feel like work. Time just goes by. You ask me how do I spend my time. This is how. Obviously I am not happy that you are so far away. I still cry. I still have my breakdowns. I still wish I could kiss you on your forehead before going to sleep. But I am proud of you building a life together. I feel so proud(and awesome) when I look at you. Abhi bhi you are taking an effort to go to the gym even after a long day. Come back soon, sab tarah se&hellip;</p>
