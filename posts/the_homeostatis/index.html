<p>Its been 22 days since I last saw you. And 54 days since I heard an &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; back. A lot changed, yet everything remained the same. There were a lot of changes to navigate and get used to, but my partner through this journey remained familiar. When things are in natural equilibrium or have been done the same way for a long time, it becomes easy to not appreciate the small things. Until a tectonic shift causes things to get messed up so much that the needle shifts to a new normal and adjusts to a new equilibrium. If we evaluate the results, have things changed completely now that the baseline has shifted? Probably yes. But looking back, the fact that a new homeostatis has been achieved even after navigating through a major shift makes us wonder whether things are stronger than ever.</p>
<p>You know I have always been the optimist. I will find the good in things. And I know the last 54 days haven&rsquo;t played out the way we expected them to, but I gained a lot of perspective from what happened. This was a &ldquo;lose everything&rdquo; kind of moment which shadowed the fact that I would not be able to see you and touch and sleep with my arms around you for a possibly long time. And it would have been extremely difficult for me to focus on everyday things once you left as I am so used to being around you since the last year. I am used to spending 24 hours with you. And all of a sudden nothing. That would have been very difficult. But after what happened, I begin to appreciate the small things again. Just the fact that I get to talk to you makes my day. I get those butterflies whenever you send an emoji or a gif or anything that displays emotion.</p>
<p>I realise you have your own life to navigate around, and that I cannot be around you all the time. I learnt this the hard way. But trust me the only reason I felt like being around you and know what you were doing was so that I could help you if anything doesn&rsquo;t go according to plan. I felt the need to know the solution to your every problem and I felt disappointed in myself if I could not do it. I did not want to control you or limit your experiences. But this distance has taught me I wasn&rsquo;t meant to be your saviour all the time. Somedays you would have you open doors for yourself, wake up in the mornings by yourself, cut chicken breast by yourself and there is nothing I could do about it. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean I have failed you. I found out I can make you happy, pamper you or take care of you from a distance. I don&rsquo;t have to be in your face or know what is happening all the time, I am happy with the fact that if you come across a problem, you would let me know and ask for help.</p>
<p>Individuality is something else that is new to me. We have our own lives around us. And with you around, I did not need anything else to be happy. But with you gone, I had to resort to other ways to not be sad (being happy and not being sad are different). I realised I had certain skills that could get me in a good mood. Cooking good food gets me in a good mood. Going to the gym and sweating some calories off gets me in a good mood. Using my skills to create something like this blog gets me in a good mood. I&rsquo;ve noticed recently that driving makes me feel good and confident about myself. Watching movies with you together and talking to you <strong>makes me happy</strong>. And all these things supplement our relationship and reduce my dependency and expectation from you to be all my happiness. I still wish I could kiss your forehead before I sleep and wake up next to you and take you shopping and cook you good food. But this detachment from my expectations is helping me stay in a good mood and be a better person for the both of us. But yeah an &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; once in a while would be great ü•∫.</p>
<p>I also realised your way of expressing love might me completely different than mine. And that I need to understand what it is rather than making you speak my language. I know you are a tough shell and you have your own ways to express emotions. Maybe I won&rsquo;t be allowed inside the shell ever again. But I have to accept this homeostasis and build my home around this shell and understand that your asking me what am I doing or eating might also mean &ldquo;I love you&rdquo;&hellip;.</p>
