<p>Everyone loves the idea of perfectionism. People have set high standards for themselves. Even in relationships. I get that feeling. Because I always wanted to be the perfect boyfriend. I wanted to be the solution for all your problems. To help you in all possible ways, to be there for you through all of your moods and just be there with a fix when you hit a blocker. And to a point I succeeded in doing so. Atleast I like to believe that way. Because I did put in a lot of effort in all of this. To make things perfect for you. For every moment of ours to be picture perfect. And this brought me real happiness. I was at peace knowing I have a person that I can call my home, who I can go back to, and I worked hard to keep things that way. What this meant for me was the good days were really good, and whenever there came a situation where I could not be of help or I messed up, I would never forgive myself. I was too critical of myself. I guess I still am. Only for you though. Because when it comes to you, I set high standards for myself.</p>
<p>When things work out, this is a perfectionism is a good problem to have. But when you start getting too critical of yourself is when things start going wrong. I heard this line on a podcast today which really struck me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Excellence does not require perfection</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perfection is the absence of any flaws. Whereas excellence is setting a high standard and achieving it, irrespective of the flaws. Because everyone has flaws. A simple example of this would be the way you cook. You are an excellent cook, probably the best in all of the friends I have and I don&rsquo;t say this because I am madly in love with you. But if you try to go the perfectionsim route, every little detail has to be perfect and you end up being critical of yourself which really isn&rsquo;t necessary. Instead, if you look at yourself compared to a year ago, you would know you&rsquo;ve come a long way in cooking CheF Jaiswal!</p>
<p>I brought up this topic because I have been that way in my work. Chasing perfetionism. Waiting for the perfect focus to strike when I can knock off most of my work and then chill later on. But two weeks in and I am still waiting. And mind you I am waiting on a lot of things :p Perfectionsim leads to procrastination. Because I am too afraid to fail, and that every time I start coding it has to be flawless from the moemnt I type something. This isn&rsquo;t helping me get any work done.</p>
<p>What I should be doing is just getting it out of my head. Trying to do the bare minimum and then keep on improving based on the feedback that I get. Also trying to improve one thing at a time. Because we humans are not meant to multitask. We can focus on one thing at a time. So trying to focus on too many things will eventually not lead to substantial progress.</p>
<p>What needs to be done instead is to focus on a 1% improvement in an area that would provide the maximum overall improvement. When it comes to me coding, that would mean trying to type valid code for 10-15 minutes everyday to get the momentum going. But I am happy I did not chase perfectionism while setting up this blog. This may not be the most good looking, blog ever. But if I keep obsessing on the font and the placement and how things should be, I would never get it done by the time I need to. I am happy that day after day I have worked on this for atleast an hour, getting stuff out. Thinking about a topic that I could write on, trying to mix my personal experiences and equate them to life&rsquo;s bigger questions. If I were to apply the same thing in our relationship, the one thing I would start working on is to stop expecting a lot of things from you. To just let you be and hope that you will come back. I need to start being an excellent boyfriend instead of a perfect one :)</p>
<p>PS: Speaking of excellence, what is the probability of a virtual date on Valentine&rsquo;s to some place that I could take you? I have been meaning to ask you but dar raha hu what might your reaction be. Maybe I should go ask you.</p>
