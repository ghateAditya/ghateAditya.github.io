<p>Uff, 13th Feb it is. One day before launch and still a bunch of logistics to figure out. But I think I will get it done in time. I just wish all of this effort brings up atleast a smile on your face. If I am able to pass through the tough shell even for a second, then all of this will be worth it. Squishmallow should be arriving tomorrow and google nest hub was a hit. I will reach your stomach first through our virtual date and then fill it up. And my plan is to reach your heart by serving this website as dessert after our date. I am curious and terrified at the same time to know the kind of impact this will have. If you like it or not. Because this is the most creative idea I have had in a long time, all because of you.</p>
<p>I wanted this post to be about vulnerability because talking or knowing about things that aren&rsquo;t normally spoken out is what formulates closeness. I always tell you jokingly about the time I took you back from the club room to the apartment new years pe, but I genuinely mean it when I say those are some of my most cherished memories. All those nights we spent in the bathroom being there for each other as we vomitted brought us closer in a lot of ways. The days when I had fever and you stayed up all night to take care of me, these are moments of gratitude and affection which I can never express to you. I don&rsquo;t know how or why but something makes me bare my soul and give you everything that I have. The kind of selfless behaviour parents have for their children. I think this feeling is eternal. I will not stop feeling this way even when we might not be on the best of terms. I will pause my way through arguments just to check if you have eaten well, if you&rsquo;re safe. Not that I am comparing but I resonate a lot with how your mom feels about you. Both of us cannot function without you.</p>
<p>And since we are on the topic of being vulnerable, I wanted to tell why I feel what I feel when I am around you. I think you made me the person I am today. When we met for the first time, I was intimidated by you. Because you are better than me in every way. And because we are so different, I always thought you may not like me at all. What if you just get bored of me? What if I am not able to provide you with all the things you&rsquo;ve always wanted? Am I capable enough to provide for us and our families to have a good future ahead? Full anxious overthinking I know, and all of this calms down only when you are around. With you I just feel at peace. I don&rsquo;t know how you do this. But your presence does drop my heartbeats to a lower level. You literally make my heart skip a beat.</p>
<p>The ultimate expression of my vulnerability is that I cannot stop my tears at all in front of you. I have no control over them. I feel the need to just bury myself in your arms and cry away both when I am at my lowest or highest. The scholarship news in itself did not mean anything to me, but you were by my side when it happened and the joy and pride on your face made the happiest. I tied my happiness to you long back which by means is meant to add pressure on you, but if Voldemort broke his soul into seven pieces and store them into objects to make himself immortal, I left a piece of my soul in you, for you. If you lived a little extra, laughed a little extra it is me who will be the happiest. I cannot get more cheesy than this. But by now you should know that you mean a lot to me. Sacchi.</p>
